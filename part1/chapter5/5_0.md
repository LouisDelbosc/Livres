##Chapter 5
##Monte Carlo Methods

The characteristics of *Monte Carlo Methods* is :
- We do not assume complete knowledge of the environment
  - in fact, we only need experience (sample data)
  - even if we have no prior knowledge of the environment dynamics, we can still attain optimal behavior
- A model is needed
  - but only the generate sample transitions are mandatory
  - not the complete probability distributions of all possible transition
    - which is require in DP
- It is a way of solving RL probl√®me based on averaging sample returns
- We assume we are on episodic tasks
  - it means experience is divided into episodes

To make a parallel to the work done previously, monte-carlo methods behave like the bandit 
methods but each state is now a bandit problem in which each bandit problems are 
interrelated.

Monte Carlo Methods use methods we saw in previous chapter (policy evaluation ...)
