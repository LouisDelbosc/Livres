###4.6 Generalized Policy Iteration

- Policy evaluation
  - making the value function consistent with the current policy
- Policy improvement
  - making the policy greedy with respect to the current value function

- *Generalized policy iteration* (GPI)
  - refer to the general idea of letting policy evaluation and policy improvement processes interact, independent of the granularity and other details of the two processes.
  - The evaluation and improvement processes can be viewed as both competing and cooperating
    - they compete because they pull in opposing directions
    - Making the policy greedy with respect to the value function makes the value function incorrect for the changed policy
    - making the value function consistent with the policy cause that policy no longer to be greedy
  - In the long run, these two processes interact to find a single joint solution
    - the optimal value function and an optimal policy

The two processes together achieve the overall goal of optimality even though neither is 
attempting to achieve it directly.
