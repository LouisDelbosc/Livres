###2.8 Associative Search

To simplify our explanation, we only considered only *non-associative* tasks, in which there is no need to associate different actions with different situations.
In a general reinforcement learning task there is more than one situation, and the goal is to learn a policy: a mapping from situations to the actions that are best in those situations.

*Associative search* task involves both **trial-and-error** learning in the form of *search* for the best actions and *association* of these actions with the situations in which they are best.


They are like the full reinforcement learning problem in that they involve learning a policy,
but like our version of the n-armed bandit problem in that each action affect the next 
situation as well as the reward, then we have the full reinforcement learning problem.
