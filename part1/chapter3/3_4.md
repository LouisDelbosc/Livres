###3.4 Unified Notation For Episodic and Continuing Tasks

To unified episodic both reinforcement learning task (episodic and continuing)
we will refer to a episodic state $$S_{t,i}$$ which is a state at time t in episode i
at $$S_t$$. We will almost always be considering a particular episode, or stating
stomething that is true for all episodes.

Also we need an other convention to unified both notation.
In continuing task we have a infinite sum. 
Considering episode termination to be the entering of a special *absorbing state*
that transition only to itself and generates only rewards of zero.

We can now define the return as :
$$\begin{align}
G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T-t-1} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
\end{align}$$

including the possibility that $$T = \infty$$ or $$\gamma = 1$$ (but not both).
